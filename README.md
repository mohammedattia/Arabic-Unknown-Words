# Arabic-Unknown-Words
Arabic Unknown Words, or words not included in Buckwalter Morphology

This is a list of unknown words, or words that are not included in the Buckwalter Morphological Analyser
version 2.0. It includes about 18,000 new lemmatized words, and they are weighted and ordered so that
there is a good likelihood that words which are most relevant (lexicographically) will surface to the top
and the least relevant words will be pushed down the list. So, for example if you take the first 2,000
words, there is a good chance that you'll find more than half of them fit to include in a dictionary.
Proper names are not filtered out because high frequency proper names are usually included in morphological
analysers to improve coverage, but in dictionaries people might want to exclude them.
